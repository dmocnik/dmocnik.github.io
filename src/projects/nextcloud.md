# Nextcloud ‚òÅ

## Overview

### Class

System Administration (CSI 3660)

### Description

The goal of this project was to host and/or create some type of service or application running on a Linux VM on Google Cloud, as well as configure the server with user groups, periodic backups, and another type of automation of our choosing.
In addition, we had to host documentation in the form of a website.
For my project, I decided to deploy [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), an open-source file hosting/productivity solution.
