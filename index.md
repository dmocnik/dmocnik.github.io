Hi! I'm Dan, a recent Computer Science graduate from Oakland University. My academic journey has allowed me to learn several programming languages like Python, Java, C, and JavaScript and gain hands-on experience in the fundamentals of CS, software development, and system administration. I'm also currently the president of the Robotics Association at Oakland University, where I primarily work on the software for our robot while leading the team in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. Some of my other computer-science related interests include natural language processing and game design/development.

When I'm not sat behind a computer somewhere, some of my hobbies include 3D printing, photography, biking, playing video games, and petting my dog.
