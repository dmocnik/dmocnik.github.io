Hi! I'm Dan, a recent Computer Science graduate from Oakland University. My academic journey has allowed me to learn several programming languages like Python, Java, C, and JavaScript and gain hands-on experience in the fundamentals of CS, software development, and system administration. I was also the president of the Robotics Association at Oakland University, where I primarily worked on the software for our robot while leading the team to compete in the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition](http://www.igvc.org/). Some of my other computer-science related interests include natural language processing and game design/development.

When I'm not sat behind a computer somewhere, some of my hobbies include 3D printing, photography, biking, playing video games, and petting my dog.
