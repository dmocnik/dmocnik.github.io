Hi! I'm Dan, a Computer Science student at Oakland University, set to graduate in April 2024. My academic journey has allowed me to learn several programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript and gain hands-on experience in robotics, system administration, and software development. I'm currently the president of the Robotics Association at Oakland University, where I primarily work on the software for our robot while leading the team in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.
